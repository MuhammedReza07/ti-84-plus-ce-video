# Video File Format Specification
This specification describes the technical details of the **Run-length Encoded Monochrome Video** (RLEMV) file format. RLEMV files shall have the extension `.rlemv`. RLEMV is designed to yield a reasonable amount of compression while still being possible to decode efficiently, making it suitable for applications such as playing monochrome video with limited computational power and memory.
